# About Me

## Here are **three** things about _me_;
1. I have two kids
1. I like sports and video Games
1. I need to get back into shape

to declare a variable in javascript, we use the keyword '`let`'

this is an example of a fat arrow function in javascript:
```javascript
const myFunc = () =>(
    console.log("my function!")
)
```
